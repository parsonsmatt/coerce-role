# coerce-role

Trying to derive something and `role`s got you down?
Use this library/trick to work around it!

This library uses a trick from [How QuantifiedConstraints can let us put join back in Monad](https://ryanglscott.github.io/2018/03/04/how-quantifiedconstraints-can-let-us-put-join-back-in-monad/).
